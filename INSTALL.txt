BASIC INSTALLATION

    To build the program type:

        make


    To strip the executables:

        make strip


    To install:

        make install


    Clean:

        make clean


    Mostly clean.

        The target mostlyclean will preserve the generated documentation files.

        make mostlyclean


INSTALLATION NAMES

    By default the 'install' target will install the program in
    /usr/bin, the language files in /usr/share/locale
    and the man page in /usr/share/man. You can specify an
    installation prefix other than /usr by modifying the
    'prefix' variable. An Example:

        make prefix=$HOME clean all
        make prefix=$HOME install


DEBUG

    A debug enabled build can be made by adding DEBUG=1
    to the make command. Example:

        make clean install DEBUG=1

    With debug enabled dos2unix will print extra information
    and you can debug the source code in gdb.


NATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT

    Native Language Support (NLS) is by default enabled.
    To disable NLS add ENABLE_NLS=. Example:

        make clean install ENABLE_NLS=


LARGE FILE SUPPORT

    Large File Support (LFS) is by default enabled. This enables
    the use of 64 bit file system interface on 32 bit systems.
    This makes it possible to open files larger than 2GB on 32 bit
    systems, provided the OS has LFS support builtin.
    To disable LFS make the LFS variable empty. Example:

        Disable LFS:
        make clean install LFS=


UNICODE SUPPORT

    Unicode UTF-16 support is by default enabled for Windows and Unix.  To
    disable make the UCS variable (Universal Character Set) empty.

        Disable Unicode:
        make clean install UCS=

    Unicode UTF-16 is not supported by the DOS and OS/2 versions.


ESPERANTO X-NOTATION

    For systems that don't support the Unicode or Latin-3 character set,
    Esperanto messages in ASCII x-notation format can be selected. Add
    EO_XNOTATION=1 to the make command-line.  It will change the format of the
    normal dos2unix 'eo' locale from Unicode to ASCII x-notation.

        make clean install EO_XNOTATION=1


DOCUMENTATION

    Manual pages are generated from Perl POD files.

    The manual pages in text and html format are by default only
    created in English language. To create text and html manuals
    for other languages type:

        make txt
        make html

    Once the manuals in non-English languages have been created,
    they will also be installed under share/doc/ when you type
    'make install'

    Creation of non-English manuals in text or html format require
    an installation of iconv.

    Manuals in PDF format are by default not created.
    To create manuals in PDF format type:

        make pdf

    PDF generation requires GhostScript to be installed.


WINDOWS PORT

    To compile a version for Windows, get the Mingw compiler
    <http://www.mingw.org>, and use makefile mingw.mak:

        make -f mingw.mak clean
        make -f mingw.mak
        make -f mingw.mak strip
        make -f mingw.mak install

    Or use Open Watcom and type:

        wmake -f wccwin32.mak clean
        wmake -f wccwin32.mak
        wmake -f wccwin32.mak install


    The win32 binaries built with MinGW32 are packed with a patched version of
    MinGW's libintl-8.dll that has builtin support for relocation. See also
    http://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/libintl.html and
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=302435&aid=3003879&group_id=2435


WINDOWS 64 BIT PORT

    To compile a version for Windows, get the Mingw-w64 compiler
    <http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net>, and use makefile mingw64.mak:

        make -f mingw64.mak clean
        make -f mingw64.mak
        make -f mingw64.mak strip
        make -f mingw64.mak install


DOS PORT, 32 BIT

    To compile a version for DOS, get the DJGPP compiler
    <http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/>, and use makefile djgpp.mak:

        make -f djgpp.mak clean
        make -f djgpp.mak
        make -f djgpp.mak strip
        make -f djgpp.mak install

    Or use Open Watcom

        wmake -f wccdos32.mak clean
        wmake -f wccdos32.mak
        wmake -f wccdos32.mak install


DOS PORT, 16 BIT

    To compile a version for DOS, use the Borland C compiler 3.1 or 4.0,
    and use makefile bcc.mak:

        make -f bcc.mak clean
        make -f bcc.mak

    Or use Open Watcom

        wmake -f wccdos16.mak clean
        wmake -f wccdos16.mak
        wmake -f wccdos16.mak install


OS/2 PORT

    Using EMX

        make -f emx.mak clean
        make -f emx.mak
        make -f emx.mak strip
        make -f emx.mak install

    Open Watcom

        wmake -f wccos2.mak clean
        wmake -f wccos2.mak
        wmake -f wccos2.mak install
